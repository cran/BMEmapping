# Wrapper to the covariance model functions

# Details:
# Calculates the distance matrix between two sets of locations
#
# Inputs:
# - c1 is a two-column matrix of coordinates (longitude/latitude) for the
#   locations in the first set.
# - c2 is a two-column matrix of coordinates (longitude/latitude) for the
#   locations in the second set.
#
# Outputs:
# - A distance matrix between two sets of locations
