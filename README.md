### Spatial Interpolation for data comprising hard and soft-interval forms

The **Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME)** framework provides a flexible and
principled approach to space-time data analysis by combining Bayesian
inference with the maximum entropy principle. It supports optimal
estimation using both precise (hard) and uncertain (soft) data, such as
intervals or probability distributionsâ€”making it ideal for complex,
real-world datasets. The **BMEmapping** R package implements core BME
methods for spatial interpolation, enabling the integration of
heterogeneous data, variogram-based modeling, and uncertainty
quantification.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **BMEmapping** from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("KinsprideDuah/BMEmapping")
```

## Functions

`prob_zk` - computes and optionally plots the posterior density estimate
at a single unobserved location.

`bme_predict` - predicts the posterior mean or mode and the associated
variance at an unobserved location.

`bme_cv` - performs a cross-validation on the hard data to assess model
performance.

## Getting help

reproducible example on
